# Experiment and sample description

This package provides the output of running Salmon on a set of 24
RNA-seq samples from Alasoo, et al. "Shared genetic effects on
chromatin and gene expression indicate a role for enhancer priming in
immune response", published in Nature Genetics, January 2018 
[doi: 10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7).

6 donors were selected from those that had publicly available reads in
ENA. The selection procress is recorded in the file
`inst/scripts/ena_download.R`, the donors were chosen as all female,
the sample having been received as frozen, and then the top 6 were
chosen based on mean purity as recorded by the study authors.
